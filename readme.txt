The WordPress Footnotes plugin supports easily and elegantly adding footnotes to any page or post on your WordPress site. All footnotes can be viewed from a central index page that shows footnotes next to related posts.

Footnotes can appear on the bottom of your article or anywhere else you may choose to display them. It is very easy to add new footnotes. A footnote can be added directly from any post or page or defined globally from the footnotes admin menu. 

The plugin works diffrently from other WordPress footnotes plugins. It creates a global table of all footnotes and let you share them between several or all posts or restrict each footnote to only a specific post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Define your footnote terms under the footnote menu item in the administration interface.  The title of the page should be the term.  The body content should be the definition.
4. Create a main footnote page (example "Footnote") with no body content if you wish to.  If you do not create this page then your terms will still be highlighted but there will not be a central listing of all your terms.
5. In the plugin's dashboard preferences, enter the main footnote page's id (optional as above)
6. There are a handful of other optional preferences available in the dashboard.

Note: You must have a call to wp_head() in your template in order for the footnote js and css to work properly.  If your theme does not support this you will need to link to these files manually in your theme (not recommended).
